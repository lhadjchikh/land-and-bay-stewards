## Technology Stack

- **Python 3.13**: Core programming language
- **Django 5.2**: Web framework
- **Django Ninja**: API framework (FastAPI-inspired)
- **GeoDjango**: For geographic data handling
- **PostGIS**: Spatial database extension for PostgreSQL
- **Poetry**: Dependency management
- **GDAL**: Geospatial Data Abstraction Library

## Project Structure

The backend is organized into several Django apps:

- **core**: Homepage content management and project configuration
- **campaigns**: Policy campaigns and related bills
- **stakeholders**: Organizations and individuals who can endorse campaigns
- **endorsements**: Relationships between stakeholders and campaigns
- **legislators**: Representatives and senators
- **regions**: Geographic regions (states, counties, etc.)
- **api**: Django Ninja API endpoints and schemas

The project is structured following standard Python package practices:

```
backend/
â”œâ”€â”€ coalition/                 # Main package
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ api/                    # API endpoints and schemas
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ campaigns/              # Campaign models and views
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ core/                   # Homepage models, settings, and configuration
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ legislators/            # Legislator models and views
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ regions/                # Region models and views
â”œâ”€â”€ stakeholders/               # Stakeholder models and admin (separate app)
â”œâ”€â”€ endorsements/               # Endorsement models and admin (separate app)
â”œâ”€â”€ scripts/                    # Utility scripts for development
â”œâ”€â”€ sample_data/                # Sample fixtures for testing
â”œâ”€â”€ manage.py                   # Django management script
â”œâ”€â”€ pyproject.toml              # Poetry dependencies and tool configuration
â””â”€â”€ poetry.lock                 # Locked dependencies
```

## Development Environment

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.13
- Poetry
- GDAL 3.10.3
- PostgreSQL 16 with PostGIS

### Local Setup

1. **Install dependencies**:

   ```bash
   cd backend
   poetry install
   ```

2. **Run migrations**:

   ```bash
   poetry run python manage.py migrate
   ```

3. **Start the development server**:

   ```bash
   poetry run python manage.py runserver
   ```

### Using Docker (Recommended)

The recommended way to run the application is using Docker Compose:

```bash
# From the project root
docker-compose up
```

This will start both the backend and frontend applications, along with a PostGIS database.

## API Endpoints

The API is available at `/api/` with the following routers:

- `/api/homepage/`: Homepage content management endpoints
- `/api/campaigns/`: Policy campaign endpoints
- `/api/stakeholders/`: Stakeholder management endpoints
- `/api/endorsements/`: Campaign endorsement endpoints
- `/api/legislators/`: Legislator endpoints

### Homepage API

#### `GET /api/homepage/`

Returns the active homepage configuration with all visible content blocks:

```json
{
  "id": 1,
  "organization_name": "Land and Bay Stewards",
  "tagline": "Protecting our coastal resources",

## Content Management

### Django Admin Interface

Coalition Builder provides a comprehensive Django admin interface for managing homepage content, campaigns, stakeholders, and other data.

#### Accessing the Admin

1. **Create a superuser account**:

   ```bash
   poetry run python manage.py createsuperuser
   ```

2. **Access the admin interface**:
   Navigate to `http://localhost:8000/admin/` and log in with your superuser credentials.

#### Homepage Management

The admin interface provides dedicated sections for managing homepage content:

**Homepage Configuration**:

- Organization information (name, tagline, contact details)
- Hero section (title, subtitle, background image)
- About section content
- Call-to-action configuration
- Social media links
- Campaign section settings

**Content Blocks**:

- Flexible content sections that can be added to the homepage
- Support for different block types: text, image, text+image, quote, statistics, custom HTML
- Drag-and-drop ordering via the `order` field
- Visibility controls for each block
- Rich content editing with HTML support

**Key Features**:

- **Single Active Homepage**: Only one homepage configuration can be active at a time
- **Content Block Management**: Add, edit, and reorder content blocks inline
- **Validation**: Built-in validation ensures data integrity
- **Preview**: Changes are immediately reflected on the frontend

#### Campaign Management

- Create and manage policy campaigns
- Associate bills with campaigns
- Track campaign status and activity

#### Stakeholder Management

- Manage organizations and individuals
- Track contact information and roles
- Categorize by stakeholder type (farmer, waterman, business, nonprofit, etc.)

#### Endorsement Management

- Link stakeholders to campaigns
- Manage endorsement statements
- Control public visibility of endorsements

### Environment-Based Configuration

The application supports environment-based configuration for different organizations:

```bash
# Set organization-specific environment variables
export ORGANIZATION_NAME="Your Organization Name"
export ORG_TAGLINE="Your organization tagline"
export CONTACT_EMAIL="contact@yourorg.org"
```

These variables serve as fallbacks when no homepage configuration exists in the database.

### Sample Data

Load sample data for development and testing:

```bash
poetry run python scripts/create_test_data.py
```

This creates sample campaigns, stakeholders, endorsements, legislators, and homepage content.

## Code Quality

### Type Checking

This project uses type annotations and encourages static type checking.

### Linting

We use several tools to ensure code quality:

- **Black**: Code formatting

  ```bash
  poetry run black .
  ```

- **Ruff**: Fast linting

  ```bash
  poetry run ruff check .
  ```

## Testing

Run the tests with:

```bash
poetry run python manage.py test
```

For debugging test issues, use the verbose flag:

```bash
poetry run python manage.py test -v 2
```

## Environment Variables

The following environment variables can be configured:

### Development Environment

- `DEBUG`: Set to `True` for development
- `SECRET_KEY`: Django secret key
- `DATABASE_URL`: Database connection URL (supports PostGIS)
- `ALLOWED_HOSTS`: Comma-separated list of allowed hosts

### Organization Configuration

- `ORGANIZATION_NAME`: Name of the organization (fallback when no homepage exists)
- `ORG_TAGLINE`: Organization tagline or slogan (fallback)
- `CONTACT_EMAIL`: Primary contact email address (fallback)

### Production Environment

In production, sensitive credentials are managed through AWS Secrets Manager for enhanced security and SOC 2 compliance:

- **Database Credentials**: Stored securely in AWS Secrets Manager
- **Master Database User**: Administrative user with full database privileges
- **Application Database User**: Restricted user for application access with secure password management

For production deployment configuration, see [DEPLOY_TO_ECS.md](../DEPLOY_TO_ECS.md) in the project root.
